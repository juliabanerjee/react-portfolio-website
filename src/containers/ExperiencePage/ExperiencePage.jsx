      <p>I have recently completed _nology's 12 week intensive Software Developer course. During this course, I learned both front-end and back-end development. The front-end side of the course focused on JavaScript and React. On the back-end side, I studied Java and work on APIs using Spring Boot and Google Cloud Platform.

        Having thoroughly enjoyed the variation on the topics on this course, I am now seeking a fullstack junior developer position.

  Below is the tech stack that I've been working with:
